    "## 4. Appling an AI model for prediction of riverbank erosion for operational application\n",
    "In this session, we will design materials for individuals interested in the operational use of an AI model for predicting riverbank erosion. Participants should have a background in river engineering from a graduate program and have begun learning about remote sensing and machine learning. They will be members of an international development project aimed at improving disaster management in Bangladesh."
