## 8.1.1 Introduction to ALOS-2 data
### a. (Basic) [Introduction to ALOS-2 data imagery](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/alos-2#alos-2-advanced-land-observing-satellite-2-sar-mission--daichi-2)

This website provides general information about the ALOS-2 (Daichi-2) satellite, their mission and its advanced SAR capabilities for Earth observation and disaster monitoring.

### b. (Basic) [Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2（ALOS-2](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/alos2/pdf/daichi2_e.pdf)

This website provides overview of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 “DAICHI-2”, mission instrument, and introduce ALOS-2’s missions and specific examples of data application.

### c. (Basic) [ALOS Data Application (Examples of Researches)](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/gallery/example.htm)

NASDA's EORC classifies ALOS data application research areas into the following 12 categories;

- PRISM / AVNIR-2: Evaluation of PRISM and AVNIR-2 involves assessing sensor characteristics, image quality, geometric and radiometric calibration and validation, and developing methods for fast and accurate extraction of geo-physical parameters.
- PALSAR: Evaluation of PALSAR focuses on assessing sensor characteristics, image quality, geometric and radiometric calibration and validation, along with enhancing analysis methods using microwave scattering and SAR interference.
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Mapping
- Land Use Monitoring and Land Cover Classification
- Disaster Monitoring
- Geological Surveying and Mineral Resource Exploration
- Terrestrial Ecosystem and Forestry Management
- Oceanography and Coastal Zone Related Research
- Snow and Ice Related Research
- Agriculture Management
- Hydrology and Water Resource Management
- Application Research using Geographical Information

## 8.1.2 (Optional) Setting up the Python environment
### a. (Basic) [Setting up a Normal Python Environment](https://pygis.io/docs/b_getting_started.html#jupyter-notebooks)

This tutorial provides a guide on setting up a Python environment for spatial programming. It covers how to install and update Anaconda, introduces Jupyter Notebooks, and demonstrates how to run Python code within a Jupyter environment.
