Explain how SAR backscatter values can be used to distinguish between water and non-water

Use figures/graphs to visually demonstrate the concept

Provide example images showing how water and non-water areas appear in SAR backscatter data

### 8.2.1.2 Implementing Otsu’s method for image segmentation
#### a. [Otsu's method](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/otsus-method)
Otsu’s method also known as Otsu's threshold algorithm, is an automatic thresholding algorithm used in image processing to separate pixels or voxels into groups based on their values in relation to the image histogram. It finds threshold values that minimize intraclass variance or maximize interclass variance. Many image processing libraries provide built-in implementations of Otsu’s method, and various extensions of it have been applied to radiological images.

Image segmentation is an important step in most computer vision applications. Image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments based on some criteria. In particular, one of the most popular methods for image segmentation is Otsu’s method. This tutorial cover the details of Otsu’s method, its advantages and limitations, and some applications.

#### c. Hands-on guidance on how to implement Otsu’s method in Python to extract water bodies areas
The tutorials below provide the example to Image processing in notebooks, including visualizing the input data, plot histogram, and visualize output after apply Otsu's method.

1. After studying the notebook linked, a learner will understand how to implement Otsu's thresholding method in Python using image processing libraries like skimage. They'll learn to apply automatic thresholding to segment images based on pixel intensity, explore the mathematical principles behind minimizing intraclass variance, and visualize results. The notebook provides practical coding examples, making it easy to follow along and apply Otsu’s method to real-world image data.

2. The webpage demonstrates Multi-Otsu thresholding, an extension of Otsu’s method used to segment an image into multiple classes based on intensity. The algorithm calculates multiple thresholds to divide pixel values, with the default setting creating three classes. The example uses Python's skimage library to apply Multi-Otsu to an image, showing the original image, histogram with thresholds, and the final segmented output.
