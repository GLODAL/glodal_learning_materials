This section introduces participants to the use of vegetation indices for monitoring vegetation cover using Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## Key Learning Objectives:
- 6.1.1 Introduction to GEE
- 6.1.2 What are vegetation indices and their applications
- 6.1.3 Monitoring vegetation with vegetation indices in GEE

## 6.1.1 Introduction to GEE
### a. (Basic) [Introduction to GEE](https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/learn/introduction-to-google-earth-engine/)
Earth Engine Explorer (EE Explorer) is a lightweight geospatial image data viewer with access to a large set of global and regional datasets available in the Earth Engine Data Catalog. It allows for quick viewing of data with the ability to zoom and pan anywhere on Earth, adjust visualization settings, and layer data to inspect change over time.

 - This tutorial will cover the use of the EE Explorer application, including:
 - how to find data in the Data Catalog
 - adding data to the Workspace
 - explanation of interface features
 - how to tailor data visualization

The goals of this tutorial are to enable you to use EE Explorer, inspire you to discover and view new data, and provide a starting point to imagine how you might expand your exploration using the other more powerful Earth Engine platform tools to answer questions about the current state and ongoing changes affecting the Earth

### b. (Basic) [Get started with GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted)
This Get Started guide is intended as a quick way to start programming with the Earth Engine JavaScript API. Google Earth Engine allows users to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors stored on Google's infrastructure. The Google Earth Engine API provides a library of functions which may be applied to data for display and analysis. Earth Engine's public data catalog contains a large amount of publicly available imagery and vector datasets. Private assets can also be created in users' personal folders.

## 6.1.2 What are vegetation indices and their applications
### a. (Basic) [What is a vegetation index ?](https://www.hiphen-plant.com/vegetation-index/)
A Vegetation Index is a single value calculated by transforming the observations from multiple spectral bands. It is used to enhance the presence of green, vegetation features and thus help to distinguish them from the other objects present in the image, depending on the transformation method and the spectral bands used.

### b. (Basic) [What are vegetation indices used for?](https://www.un-spider.org/links-and-resources/data-sources/daotm/daotm-vegetation#:~:text=In%20general%20terms%2C%20vegetation%20indices,of%20the%20plant's%20photosynthetic%20activity.)
Vegetation indices derived from Earth observation satellites are important for a wide range of applications such as vegetation monitoring, drought studies, agricultural activities, climate and hydrologic modeling. Vegetation monitoring plays an important role in drought early warning systems, which help to anticipate the risk of food crises at local and global scale.

### c. (Basic) [Application of vegetation indices](https://www.icimod.org/capacity-building/2021/WoGIT%20Afg/D3_Indices_application.pdf)
 - Vegetation mapping and monitoring
 - Biodiversity assessment
 - Estimation of biophysical parameters (LAI, fPAR)
 - Phenological assessment 
 - Vegetation health/stress

 - Biomass mapping and modelling
 - Productivity and carbon assessment
 - Crop condition monitoring and predicting crop yield

## 6.1.3 Monitoring vegetation with vegetation indices in GEE

### a. [Time-series of NDVI from 2014~2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243421003470#b0440)
Time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from remote sensing images, is widely applied in various fields including vegetation change monitoring , landcover type classification, environmental dynamic simulation, vegetation phenology extraction and so on. As one of the best indicators of vegetation growth state and coverage, NDVI is inversed by the ratio of near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) reflectance. These two bands, containing over 90% of vegetation information, are ubiquitous in earth observation satellites. The time series of NDVI refers to the analysis of NDVI data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into trends, patterns, and changes in vegetation cover and health across different seasons or years.


#### Key Components of NDVI Time Series:

1. [NDVI Calculation](https://jdmwhite.github.io/Intro_to_Spatial/NDVI_time_series.html):
   - NDVI is calculated using the formula:
                NDVI = (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red)

        - NIR (Near-Infrared): Reflectance in the NIR band (typically around 0.7–1.1 µm).
        - Red: Reflectance in the visible red band (around 0.6–0.7 µm).

   - NDVI values range from -1 to +1, where higher positive values indicate dense, healthy vegetation, and values close to 0 or negative values indicate little to no vegetation.


2. [Time Series Analysis](https://chatgpt.com/share/01520745-b607-49c4-a9cd-b64c7533e5be):
   - [Temporal Resolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253517303676): NDVI data can be collected at various time intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. The choice of temporal resolution depends on the specific application and the availability of data.
   - [Trend Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140196314001797): By analyzing NDVI data over time, it’s possible to observe long-term trends, such as increases or decreases in vegetation cover. This is useful for monitoring environmental changes, such as deforestation, urbanization, or the effects of climate change.
   - [Seasonal Patterns](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/31971): NDVI time series often exhibit seasonal cycles corresponding to the growth and senescence of vegetation. For example, in temperate regions, NDVI typically peaks during the growing season (spring and summer) and declines in winter.
   - [Anomalies Detection](https://conservancy.umn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/4e9483bd-08fd-48b4-b6fd-5b2cc74c3129/content): Time series can help detect unusual changes in vegetation, such as those caused by droughts, floods, pest infestations, or land-use changes.

3. [Data Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index):
   - NDVI data can be derived from various remote sensing platforms, such as satellites (e.g., MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2) and UAVs (drones).
   - Data from these sources can be processed to create NDVI maps and time series datasets, which can be analyzed using software like Python, R, or GIS tools.

#### [Visualization](https://www.aicg.com/blog/how-to-visualize-time-series-data-with-examples/):
- NDVI Time Series Plot: Typically, NDVI values are plotted on the Y-axis, and time (e.g., days, months, years) is on the X-axis. The resulting curve shows how NDVI changes over time.

### b. [Monitoring vegetation using vegetation indices in Google Earth Engine](https://chatgpt.com/share/e54c0606-7e47-4c30-92de-4f7d3ec719f7)
Monitoring vegetation using vegetation indices like NDVI and EVI in Google Earth Engine (GEE) involves analyzing satellite imagery to assess vegetation health and coverage of vegetation over time. GEE, a cloud-based platform, enables users to generate maps and time series analyses that track changes in vegetation, plant health, plant growth, detect deforestation, forest growth or expansion, manage agriculture, and study ecological dynamics. Its extensive data catalog and computational power make GEE a crucial tool for environmental research and management on a global scale.

### c. Hands-on for Monitoring vegetation using vegetation indices
In this hands-on, we will use Landsat 8 satellite imagery and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to monitor vegetation changes from 2014 to 2024 using Google Earth Engine (GEE). By analyzing data over this decade, we can observe trends and changes in vegetation (mangroves) around Safwa Bay, Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia.
