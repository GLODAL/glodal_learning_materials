#### Publishing Your App

Create an App: To publish an App from the Code Editor

- First load the script that you want to make into an App
- Then open the App Management panel, which you can access by clicking the "Apps" button above the script section in the Code Editor.
- Then click on the "NEW APP" button. 
- In the dialog, choose editor access, an App name, select a Google Cloud Project, and specify the location of the App's source code. Restrict access to this App to a particular Google Group or keep it publicly accessible using options under the Restriction tab. For publicly accessible apps, you can also provide a custom preview image for the App as well as a description in the Gallery tab. Click "Feature this app in your Apps Gallery" if you would like this App to appear on your public gallery of apps available at USERNAME.users.earthengine.app. Optionally include a custom logo in the upper-left corner of the App by uploading an image of your choice from the Logo tab.
- The last step is click "PUBLISH" button.  


Managing Your Apps:
To manage an App from the Code Editor, open the App Management panel by clicking the Apps button above the script section in the Code Editor. From here you can update your App's configuration or delete the app.
