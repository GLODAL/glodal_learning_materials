This content presents the essential components of a web GIS application. As a GIS practitioner, you aim to create applications that are user-friendly and require minimal GIS knowledge from end users. To achieve this, you need to integrate five key elements:
- A web application
- Digital basemaps
- Operational layers
- Tasks and tools in the web GIS application
- One or more geodatabase

### b. WebGIS application for public data access
#### (Advanced) [Explore the disaster occurrences in South East Asia region](https://portal.geoinfo.ait.ac.th/portal/apps/sites/#/gic-ait-disaster-response-portal/pages/emergency-response-mapping)
This content aim to  explores the Disaster Occurrences in South East Asia Region.

#### (Advanced) [Development of a Web-based GIS solution for flood inundation mapping and assessment in Lahore, Pakistan](https://journal.50sea.com/index.php/IJIST/article/view/484/1057)
The study highlights the integration of Web-GIS for effective flood hazard mapping and management. Using HEC-RAS 1D, the research mapped flooded areas around River Ravi in Lahore. An interactive flood measuring tool was developed using a Web-GIS stack comprising Geo Server, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Geo Server facilitated OGC standards and specific capabilities like WMS Animator for visualizing flood inundation and CQL filter for precise flood measurement.
