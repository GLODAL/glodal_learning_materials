### a. (Basic) [A framework for deploying web GIS applications](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/10.5/create-web-apps/linux/a-framework-for-deploying-web-gis-applications.htm)
This content presents the essential components of a web GIS application. As a GIS practitioner, you aim to create applications that are user-friendly and require minimal GIS knowledge from end users. To achieve this, you need to integrate five key elements:
- A web application
- Digital basemaps
- Operational layers
- Tasks and tools in the web GIS application
- One or more geodatabase

### b. WebGIS application for public data access
#### (Advanced) [Explore the disaster occurrences in South East Asia region](https://portal.geoinfo.ait.ac.th/portal/apps/sites/#/gic-ait-disaster-response-portal/pages/emergency-response-mapping)
