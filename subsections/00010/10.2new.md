## 10.2.1 Understanding color composite (RGB)

### a. [ALOS User Handbook](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/doc/alos_userhb_en.pdf)

This article present the false colour composite where the co-polarisation (HH) band is displayed in the red channel, the cross-polarisation band (HV) in the green and the (HH-HV) difference in the blue channel. With the HH banc sensitive to direct and specular backscatter and the HV band to volume scattering, forest appears green, clear cut areas dark purple, open water black, and flooded vegetation light violet.

Forest change monitoring is a key application of PALSAR, focusing on identifying and tracking human-induced and natural disturbances in global land cover. Regular monitoring is essential, especially in threatened areas like forests and wetlands, as it provides crucial data on where and when changes occur. Multi-temporal SAR color composites are an effective tool for disturbance mapping, offering clear insights into both spatial and temporal changes.

Wetlands monitoring using L-band SAR, like PALSAR and JERS-1, is essential for mapping spatio-temporal inundation patterns, particularly under forest canopies, which optical sensors or shorter wavelength SARs cannot detect. The long wavelength L-band signals can penetrate forest canopies and interact with the ground, enabling the detection of flooding through "double-bounce" reflections between tree trunks and the water surface. Flooded areas reflect a strong signal, appearing bright in SAR imagery, while open water or non-flooded areas show weaker returns, making L-band SAR a powerful tool for detecting forest inundation.

### b. [ALOS-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2) / Daichi-2](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/alos-2#mission-status)

This article present the colour composite in the image represents HH polarisation in red, HV polarisation in green, and HH/HV in blue. In this image, black or dark blue roughly show water or bare land, green shows the vegetation-covered areas, and bright green or purple show the urban areas.


## 10.2.2 Creating RGB color composite image

### a. [Benefits of Combining ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A Data in the Classification of Land Cover Classes in the Santa Catarina Southern Plateau](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/2/229#)

This article shows an example of RGB color composite image using the ALOS/PALSAR-2 data (R:HH, G:HV, B:VV).
