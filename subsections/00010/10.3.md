## 10.3.1 Creating the time-series data 

### a. [The Complete Guide to Time Series Forecasting Models](https://medium.com/@wainaina.pierre/the-complete-guide-to-time-series-forecasting-models-ef9c8cd40037)

This website provides a comprehensive overview of Time Series Forecasting. It explains how to analyze data that changes over time, using statistical models to make predictions about future trends.

Learners wil understand the points below from this content:
1. **Time Series Data Characteristics:** Data points are ordered chronologically, and each observation is dependent on the previous one. Understanding trends, seasonality, and noise helps in analyzing the data.
2. **Importance of Stationarity:** Stationary data, where properties like mean and variance stay constant, is easier to analyze. Stationarity ensures that statistical models, such as ARIMA, perform accurately.
3. **Time Series Models:** Several models like AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning models (RNNs, LSTMs) are used to capture patterns and predict future values. Each model is suitable for different types of time series data (e.g., with or without seasonality or trends).
4. **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE help in assessing the accuracy of these models. Cross-validation techniques ensure models generalize well to new data.
5. **Python vs. R:** Both languages are effective for time series forecasting. Python is more versatile, especially for machine learning, while R excels in statistical modeling and visualization.

### b. [Time-Series Analysis of Satellite Data: Unveiling Trends and Patterns](https://flypix.ai/blog/time-series-analysis-of-satellite-data-unveiling-trends-and-patterns/)

The article on time-series analysis of satellite data:
1. **Understanding Changes Over Time:** Time-series analysis of satellite imagery helps monitor and interpret changes in the Earth's surface, such as vegetation, water bodies, and infrastructure, by analyzing images captured at regular intervals over a period of time.
2. **Applications in Environmental and Urban Monitoring:** This technique is valuable for various applications like monitoring vegetation health (using indices like NDVI), detecting deforestation, assessing sea level rise, coastal erosion, and analyzing urbanization trends and land use changes.
3. **Disaster Response and Recovery:** Time-series analysis is crucial for assessing the impact of natural disasters. It helps emergency responders and policymakers allocate resources, plan recovery efforts, and make informed decisions on infrastructure rebuilding and long-term recovery.
4. **Challenges in Data Analysis:** The process faces challenges like ensuring the quality of satellite imagery, managing large datasets with high computational demands, and requiring domain expertise for accurate interpretation of trends.
5. **Future Potential and Technological Advancements:** As technology advances, time-series analysis will continue to improve, offering deeper insights into environmental and societal changes. Platforms like FlyPix AI aim to simplify and enhance this analysis, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions.

### c. [Creating time-series data from ALOS-2 imagery]()

For this tutorial, we provide hands-on guidance on how to prepare time-series data from ALOS-2 imagery. This hands-on provided step-by-step instructions to prepare time-series data from ALOS-2 imagery in Python.

The code processes ALOS-2 satellite images by loading an Area of Interest (AOI) shapefile and a list of image paths, followed by a series of steps for each image: clipping it to the AOI, applying calibration using a logarithmic transformation, and filtering with a Lee filter. Each processed image—original clipped, calibrated, and filtered—is visualized side by side for comparison. The filtered images are resized to a common shape to ensure consistency, and they are then stacked into a multi-band GeoTIFF file. Finally, the stacked image is saved to a specified output path, allowing for further analysis of the time-series data.
