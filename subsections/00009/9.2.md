## 9.2.1 Methods for interpreting forest and oil palm  

Interpreting forest and oil palm using ALOS-2 data involves advanced techniques in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) analysis, which can be backed by various research studies and methods. 

### Polarimetric SAR Analysis
Polarimetric Decomposition Techniques: Polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data from ALOS-2 can be decomposed using methods like the Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi decomposition. These techniques help distinguish different scattering mechanisms, such as surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, and volume scattering, which are key to differentiating forests and oil palm plantations.

### Backscatter Analysis
Analysis of Backscatter Coefficient (σ⁰): By examining the radar backscatter at different polarizations (HH, HV, VH, VV), different land cover types can be identified. Forests generally have higher HV backscatter due to complex canopy structures, while oil palm plantations might show distinctive patterns due to regular tree arrangements.

### Time-Series Analysis
Temporal Monitoring: Time-series analysis of ALOS-2 data can reveal patterns and changes in land cover over time. Regular monitoring can help detect deforestation or the growth of oil palm plantations.

### Machine Learning Classification
Supervised Learning: Supervised classification techniques like Random Forest or Support Vector Machines can be applied to ALOS-2 data to classify land cover. These methods require training datasets that represent the classes of interest, such as forest and oil palm.

### Interferometric SAR (InSAR)
Vegetation Height Estimation: InSAR techniques can be used to estimate the height of vegetation, which can help differentiate between tall forest trees and shorter oil palm trees.

### Combination with Optical Data
Data Fusion: Combining SAR data from ALOS-2 with optical data (e.g., from Landsat or Sentinel-2) can significantly improve land cover classification accuracy.

The global forest/non-forest map (FNF) is generated by classifying the backscattering intensity values in the global 25m resolution PALSAR-2/PALSAR mosaic so that strong and low backscatter in HV-polarization are classified "forest" (colored in green) and "non-forest" (colored in yellow), respectively. Here, "forest" is defined as the natural forest with the area larger than 0.5ha and forest cover over 90%, as same to the FAO definition. Since the radar backscatter from the forest depends on the region (climate zone), the classification of Forest/Non-forest is conducted by using the region dependent threshold of backscatter. The classification accuracy is more than 84% according to the comparison with reference data such as in-situ photos and high-resolution optical satellite images

In this paper, three classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree and K-Means) were explored to map oil palm plantations in Cameroon, using PALSAR 50 m Orthorectified Mosaic images and differently sized training samples.

For large-scale mapping of oil palm plantations, the Decision Tree algorithm outperformed both SVM and K-Means in terms of speed and performance. In addition, the decision threshold values of Decision Tree for a large training sample size agrees with the results from previous studies, which implies the possible universality of the decision threshold.

The workflow for oil palm mapping. Multiple classification approaches were carried out and their accuracies were assessed. We evaluated an unsupervised method (K-Means classification), a decision tree method (QUEST), and a machine learning method (SVM). SVM and K-Means algorithms were implemented with ENVI 5.0 software. The QUEST algorithm was implemented with RuleGenTool embedded into ENVI 5.0.

 In this study, oil palm mapping in Malaysia over the past decade (2007–2016) was produced annually, using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-1 Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR)-1 (2007–2010) images and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (2015 and 2016) images at 100 m resolution with maximum likelihood classifier-based supervised classification. 

Two independent verification systems (testing samples and Malaysian Palm Oil Board statistics) were used to evaluate the mapping accuracy. The average overall accuracy for the six years was 94.62% and the accuracy of oil palm mapping was greater than 83%. The results show the dynamics of oil palm distribution from 2007 to 2016. Two approaches (i.e. pixel counting (PC) and error matrix-based model-assisted (EM)) were used to estimate the oil palm area from the maps.

This study aims to map forest, especially evergreen forest (above 2 m in height) in the SGP for the time period of 2015–2017. Annual mosaic data of HH and HV polarization backscattering (25 m) from Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) aboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), along with their difference (HH-HV) and ratio (HH/HV) were utilized. With the four bands (HH, HV, difference, ratio) of 2017, decision rules of forest were developed based on 30 randomly selected forest plots (as of 2017) across the study area.

Information about oil palm phenology is required for oil palm plantation management, but using spaceborne polarimetric radar imagery remains challenging. However, spaceborne polarimetric radar on X-, C-, and L-band is promising on structure vegetation and cloud area. This study investigates the scattering model of oil palm phenology based on spaceborne X-, C-, and L-band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The X-, C-, and L-band polarimetric SAR are derived from spaceborne of TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A, and ALOS PALSAR 2.

The methodology includes data collection,preprocessing, radiometric calibration, speckle ﬁltering, ter-rain correction, extracting scattering value, and developmentscattering model based on spaceborne X-, C-, and L-bandpolarimetric SAR
