## How to prepare time-series observations


The comparison of ALOS-2 SAR imagery between 2007 and 2020 for detecting oil palm plantations and deforestation can reveal significant changes in land cover. Using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, like that from ALOS-2, helps to detect changes in vegetation structure, deforestation, and land-use conversion.

#### Oil Palm Plantations
A major cause of deforestation, can be distinguished in SAR imagery due to their structured planting patterns.

#### Deforestation
Deforestation results in the removal of dense vegetation, which is converted to agricultural land, such as oil palm plantations.
