# 9.1 Python coding for reading and visualizing ALOS-2 images

## Key learning objectives:
-  9.1.1 Introduction to ALOS-2 data
-  9.1.2 Reading and visualizing ALOS-2 data

## 9.1.1 Introduction to ALOS-2 data 
- Provide a brief introduction to the ALOS-2 satellite

### (Basic) [ ALOS Data Users Handbook ](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/doc/fdata/ALOS_HB_RevC_EN.pdf)

The purpose of this document is to provide various information needed for users to effectively use data obtained through ALOS. We introduce not only various information related to standard products, but also information related to ALOS itself, as well as other related information about the sensors on the Satellite and the ground systems. 

### (Basic) [ALOS-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2; SAR mission](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/alos-2#alos-2-advanced-land-observing-satellite-2-sar-mission--daichi-2)

ALOS-2 features an imaging microwave radar, PALSAR-2 (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2); and a multi-purpose imaging vis/IR (visual/infrared) radiometer, CIRC (Compact InfraRed Camera). PALSAR-2 monitors Japanese natural disasters, land and agriculture, and also explores natural resources in the ground and seabeds of Japan. The instrument also monitors forests to contribute to global warming issues on an international scale. CIRC measures land surface temperature, and therefore also acts as a detector of active fires.

- Highlight the key applications of ALOS-2 data, especially for detecting changes in forest and plantation areas

### (Basic) [Generating Large-Scale High-Quality SAR Mosaic Datasets: Application to PALSAR Data for Global Monitoring](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224183347_Generating_Large-Scale_High-Quality_SAR_Mosaic_Datasets_Application_to_PALSAR_Data_for_Global_Monitoring)

ALOS-2’s SAR data is especially useful for monitoring forest cover changes, including deforestation and forest degradation. The L-band radar is capable of penetrating forest canopies, making it suitable for mapping biomass and detecting logging activities even in dense tropical forests or under cloud cover.

This paper proposes a mosaicking algorithm to produce large-scale radiometrically and geometrically calibrated Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets as a base for environmental monitoring of terrestrial biospheric and cryospheric changes. Features of the proposed method are thematic inclusion of a) long-strip processing of the SAR data, b) ortho-rectification and slope correction using a digital elevation model, c) suppression of differences in intensity between neighboring strips, and d) preparation of metadata (e.g., dates from launch, local incidence angle, radar shadow, layover, and valid/invalid data) to support dataset interpretation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) mosaics for Southeast Asia, Australia, and Africa.


## 9.1.2 Reading and visualizing ALOS-2 data

- Basic Python for EO data processing
    - Provide hands-on examples to demonstrate Python operations, such as reading, writing files, defining functions, and basic data manipulation

- Loading ALOS-2 Data
    - Explain the data format (*.tif)
    - Provide hands-on guidance on how to load ALOS-2 data using Python

To load ALOS-2 data using Python, you typically use libraries like Rasterio for geospatial raster data and GDAL for more advanced geospatial data manipulation. These libraries can be used to read and manipulate ALOS-2 data, which is often in GeoTIFF or other raster formats.



- Visualizing ALOS-2 Data
    - Introduce basic visualization techniques using libraries such as matplotlib

Visualization is an essential part of data analysis as it helps to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. In Python, one of the most widely used libraries for data visualization is Matplotlib. Here's an introduction to basic visualization techniques using Matplotlib, along with other useful libraries like Seaborn (for statistical plotting) and Pandas (for quick plotting from dataframes).

### (Basic) [Data Visualization using Matplotlib in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-visualization-using-matplotlib/)

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of data analysis, enabling data scientists and analysts to present complex data in a more understandable and insightful manner. One of the most popular libraries for data visualization in Python is Matplotlib. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to using Matplotlib for creating various types of plots and customizing them to fit specific needs and how to visualize data with the help of the Matplotlib library of Python.

### (Basic) [ALOS/ALOS-2 PALSAR/PALSAR-2 Annual Mosaics](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/sandbox/notebooks/Datasets/ALOS_PALSAR_Annual_Mosaic.html)
The ALOS/ALOS2 PALSAR Annual Mosaic is a global 25 m resolution dataset that combines data from many images captured by JAXA’s PALSAR and PALSAR-2 sensors on ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 satellites respectively. This product contains radar measurement in L-band and in HH and HV polarizations. It has a spatial resolution of 25m and is available annually for 2007 to 2010 (ALOS/PALSAR) and 2015 to 2022 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2). ALOS/ALOS2 PALSAR mosaic data is part of a global dataset provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Observation Research Center. Historically, the JERS annual mosaic is generated from images acquired by the SAR sensor on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) satellite.
