    "\n",
    "### Introduction to deep learning\n",
    "The term ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’ has been introduced for 50 years and still it is in the global trend. These days machine learning (ML) is interchangeably used for AI as it is one of the most popular and successful sub-branches of AI. Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks, to mimic human like decision making behavior and try to find the most optimal path to a solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep learning for image recognition\n",
    "Deep Learning has been exceptionally powerful when it comes to image recognition. Using the neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks), these models can automatically learn features and pattern directly from raw image data, significantly outperforming traditional image processing methods.\n",
    "## 2.2 Benefits\n",
    "### Application in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning for object detection has a wide range of practical applications, including:\n",
    "* **Automated Surveillance:** Enhancing security systems by accurately detecting and classifying objects in real-time.\n",
    "* **Autonomous Vehicles:** Enabling self-driving cars to recognize and respond to various objects on the road.\n",
    "* **Medical Imaging:** Assisting in the detection of anomalies in medical scans, improving diagnostic accuracy.\n",
    "* **Industrial Automation:** Streamlining manufacturing processes by identifying and categorizing different components.\n",
    "* **Remote Sensing (RS) and Earth Observation (EO):** Deep learning models can analyze satellite and aerial imagery with high precision, improving environmental monitoring and disaster response. For example, they can detect deforestation, urban expansion, and climate change impacts, as well as rapidly identify areas affected by natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. This facilitates timely decision-making and efficient resource allocatio.\n"

These settings, known as hyperparameters, are not learned from the training data but set prior to the training process. Effective tuning of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, optimizer type, and the number of epochs can significantly impact the model’s accuracy and convergence speed. In mmdetection, hyperparameters are configured in the model’s configuration file and can be fine-tuned based on the specific dataset and task requirements to achieve better performance.
