    "Human pressure on coastal areas is increasing due to resource depletion, climate change, and ocean eutrophication, which threaten ecosystem services like carbon uptake and biodiversity maintenance. Coastal ecosystems, particularly seaweeds, are crucial for carbon sinks and high-value products for the cosmetic and food industries. Efficient monitoring is essential to track environmental dynamics and resource trends. Traditional seaweed monitoring involves field surveys and genetic studies, but recent advancements in Remote Sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer more efficient tools. This study tests the potential of these techniques for seaweed monitoring along Ireland's west coast, aiming for a fully automated monitoring tool. Using a supervised classification approach, Random Forest (RF) achieved high accuracy, with the best configuration yielding an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 98.87%."

    "Accurate measurement, mapping, and monitoring of mangrove forests are crucial for sustainable management of mangrove blue carbon in the Asia-Pacific region. This study reviewed 105 remote sensing-based articles from 1990 to June 2023, highlighting the use of remote sensing and modeling to estimate mangrove blue carbon stocks effectively. Despite significant mangrove coverage, countries like Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Papua New Guinea had fewer studies. The most frequently used sensors included Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat 8 OLI, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, with machine learning models like Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boost showing high accuracy. Research gaps were noted in below-ground carbon and carbon stock valuation studies. To enhance blue carbon measurement accuracy, the study recommends standardized methodologies and periodic technical monitoring (every 2-5 years) using remote sensing, which could support sustainable mangrove management and benefit carbon markets in developing Asia-Pacific countries.\n",

    "Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), such as mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, are increasingly recognized for their role in natural climate solutions. Evaluating their current extent, losses, and gains is crucial for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and informing policy. Remote sensing is particularly suited for assessing BCE dynamics over various spatial and temporal scales. This study analyzed 2193 papers from 1990 to June 2022, showing a 16.9% annual growth in publications. Mangrove ecosystems were the primary focus, utilizing the Landsat mission for its long-term, open-access data. Recent technologies like LiDAR, UAVs, and acoustic sensors have advanced fine-scale mapping. Major research topics include mapping natural and human impacts, estimating vegetation and biophysical parameters, and employing machine learning algorithms. The United States, China, Australia, and India lead the field. The study highlights the need for more research on seagrasses, saltmarshes, and macroalgae, integrating technologies, supporting carbon accounting methodologies, and enhancing international collaboration. Advances in remote sensing technology and reduced costs are expected to boost BCE research and management.\n",

    "The concept of blue carbon, emerging in the last decade, is pivotal for global climate governance, biodiversity conservation, and fishery resource restoration. This study used CiteSpace visualization software to analyze 3474 papers from the Web of Science Core Collection (2003–2022), mapping international blue carbon research, identifying hotspots, and suggesting future directions for ocean and coastal management. Blue carbon research has evolved through an early exploration period (2003–2007), a development period (2008–2015) focusing on carbon sequestration mechanisms, and a recent outbreak period (2016–2022) emphasizing carbon sink system quantification and management. While institutional and international collaborations are robust, author collaborations need improvement. Research hotspots include coastal wetlands, particularly mangroves, and current focuses are on functional protection and management strategies for coastal ecosystems. Future priorities include protecting, restoring, and creating blue carbon ecosystems, promoting blue carbon trading through sustainable marine ranching, exploring emerging blue carbon potentials, and enhancing social-level management. This comprehensive bibliometric and visual analysis offers valuable insights for scholars, managers, and governments.\n",

    "Blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and saltmarshes, are among the most carbon-dense and productive coastal habitats, serving as vital nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, accurately quantifying blue carbon stocks using remote sensing is challenging due to issues like cloud coverage, limitations of multispectral sensors, and speckle noise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Recent technological advancements, such as airborne and space-borne multispectral and SAR imagery, LiDAR data, UAV platforms, and innovative machine learning techniques, provide diverse spectral, spatial, and multi-temporal data for blue carbon assessment. Nevertheless, challenges persist due to atmospheric correction, water penetration, data dimensionality, limited training samples, and SAR backscattering mechanisms. Emerging machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, particularly those using open-source software, are essential for reliable blue carbon estimates. This review highlights the use of Earth Observation data, machine learning, and deep learning techniques for quantifying carbon stocks in these ecosystems and discusses key limitations and future directions, emphasizing the potential of data fusion combined with advanced methodologies to enhance blue carbon quantification and support global climate mitigation efforts.\n",

    "Blue carbon ecosystems (BCE), including mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, are crucial for climate change mitigation but are under threat. Remote sensing offers a promising solution for transparent, replicable, and cost-effective BCE monitoring at various scales. Despite challenges, the UNFCCC guidelines support incorporating blue carbon inventories into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), though specific guidance on remote sensing techniques is lacking. This review creates a roadmap for applying remote sensing to develop cost-effective carbon inventories, covering current guidelines, mapping technologies, methods for translating habitat maps into carbon estimates, and a decision tree to assist users based on their needs and resources. The review aims to support UNFCCC-approved IPCC guidelines with recommendations on remote sensing for GHG inventories, emphasizing that these technologies are robust and cost-effective for monitoring blue carbon assets. Greater appreciation and use of these techniques can enhance the scalability of blue carbon as a natural climate solution globally.\n",

    "Mangrove forests play a crucial role in mitigating global warming through carbon sequestration, which is essential for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gases. This study aims to develop a regression model correlating the vegetation index with the carbon stock of mangrove forests, enabling easier estimation of carbon stocks from satellite imagery, specifically in Benoa, Bali. The analysis combined vegetation index approaches (ARVI and EVI from Sentinel 2-A satellite imagery) with statistical regression analysis, using biomass values derived from allometric equations. The ARVI-based regression model showed the highest accuracy, with an exponential regression model being the most effective for predicting carbon stock values. "
