<!--
#### What is remote sensing?
- Remote sensing involves obtaining information about objects from a distance, with photography being a common method. 
- Data collection can be ground-based, airborne, or spaceborne, and depends on the information needed, the level of detail, and data frequency.
- The energy from the sun, known as electromagnetic radiation, is reflected, absorbed, and emitted by Earth's atmosphere and surface. Satellites with sensors measure this radiation to analyze various features of Earth's spheres. The electromagnetic spectrum includes all wave frequencies, though most are undetectable by the human eye. Different materials have unique spectral signatures based on their reflectance and absorption of different wavelengths. For instance, vegetation reflects near-infrared light, making healthy plants appear green, while water absorbs longer wavelengths, making it appear blue. Atmospheric correction helps obtain accurate surface reflectance by removing atmospheric scattering and absorption effects.

#### Satellite characteristics
- Orbits: Polar/Non-Polar Orbit vs. Geostationary
- Energy Source: Passive vs. Active
- Solar and Terrestrial Spectra: Visible, UV, IR, Microwave
- Measurement Technique: Scanning; Non-Scanning; Imager; Sounders
- Resolution Type and Quality: Spatial, Temporal, Spectral, Radiometric
- Application: Weather, Ocean Color, Land Mapping, Air Quality, Radiation Budget, etc.

#### Satellite data processing levels
Satellite data is available at different stages (or levels) of processing, going from raw data collected from the satellite to polished products that visualize information.
- Level 0 & 1 is the raw instrument data that may be time-referenced. It is the most difficult to use.
- Level 2 is Level 1 data that has been converted into a geophysical quantity through a computer algorithm (known as retrieval). This data is geo-referenced and calibrated.
- Level 3 is Level 2 data that has been mapped on a uniform space-time grid and quality controlled.
- Level 4 is Level 3 data that has been combined with models or other instrument data.

#### Projections and coordinate systems
- All spatial data, including satellite imagery, must be indexed, or georeferenced, to a fixed point on Earth’s surface.
- Pairing a data point or pixel with a specific location on the ground requires a coordinate reference system (CRS).
- Two types of coordinate systems are commonly used, geographic and projected.

#### Advantages and disadvantages of remote sensing
##### Advantages
- Provides information where there are no ground-based measurements.
- Provides globally consistent observations.
- Provides continuous monitoring of our planet.
- Earth systems models integrate surface -based and remote sensing observations and provide uniformly gridded, frequent information of water resources data parameters.
- Data are freely available and there are web -based tools for data analysis.
##### Disadvantages
- It is very difficult to obtain high spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolution all at the same time.
- Large amounts of data in a variety of formats can lead to more time and processing.
- Applying satellite data may require additional processing, visualization, and other tools.
- While the data are generally validated with selected surface measurements, regional and local assessment is recommended.
  
#### Remote sensing terminology
- Coordinate Reference System: A coordinate-based local, regional, or global system used to locate geographical entities.
- Spatial Resolution: The ground surface area that forms one pixel in the image.
- Georeference: To link spatial data to its correct location.

### c. Understanding geospatial data and their sources
#### [Vector data](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/vector_data.html)

You will learn the points below from this content:
1. Vector Data Representation: Vector data in GIS represents real-world features using points, lines, or polygons.
2. Geometry Types: Points are single vertices, polylines are connected lines with two or more vertices, and polygons are enclosed areas with at least four vertices.
3. Attribute Data: Each vector feature is described by attribute data, providing additional details about the feature.
4. Digitizing Process: Creating digital vector data by drawing in GIS is known as digitizing, which can introduce quality issues like undershoots, overshoots, and slivers.
5. Application in GIS: Vector data is used for spatial analysis, such as finding the nearest hospital to a school, but you typically cannot mix geometry types within a single GIS layer.

<!--
- Point
A point is composed of one coordinate pair representing a specific location in a coordinate system. Points are the most basic geometric primitives having no length or area.

- Line String
Lines usually represent features that are linear in nature. For example, maps show rivers, roads, and pipelines as vector lines.

- Polygon
Polygon features are enclosed areas like dams, islands, country boundaries and so on. Like polyline features, polygons are created from a series of vertices that are connected with a continuous line. 
-->

#### Vector data file formats
- **GeoJSON:** GeoJSON is an open standard format specifically designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It can accommodate diverse types of geographical features such as points, line strings, polygons, and multi-part collections of these types. One of its primary advantages is its readability - both by humans and machines, as it stores all the relevant data in a single text file.
- **GeoPackage:** GeoPackage is a modern, open standard data format that adopts the principles of open format standards, ensuring non-proprietary access and wide compatibility. It leverages SQLite, a widely used, self-contained, and serverless transactional SQL database engine, making it an exceptionally portable and lightweight choice for data storage.
- **Shapefile:** A Shapefile is akin to a feature class – it stores a set of features that share a common geometry type (point, line, or polygon), possess the same attributes, and occupy a shared spatial extent.

#### [Raster Data](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/raster_data.html)

You will learn the points below from this content:
1. Raster Data Structure: Raster data consists of a grid of regularly sized pixels, with the pixel size determining the spatial resolution.
2. Use for Varying Information: Raster data is ideal for representing continuously varying information.
3. Bands in Raster Images: Raster images can have one or more bands, each containing different information, with multi-spectral images having bands from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
4. Visualization of Bands: Multi-spectral images can be displayed using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors, while single-band images are shown as grayscale or pseudocolor.
5. Storage Requirements: Raster images can require a significant amount of storage space due to their large data volume.

#### Raster Data File Formats
- **GeoTiff:** GeoTIFF is a widely-used raster data format in the public domain. It is a great choice when you prioritize portability and platform independence as it embeds spatial information within the TIFF image file itself.

#### [Point cloud](https://flyguys.com/point-cloud/#:~:text=A%20point%20cloud%20is%20a%20collection%20of%20individual,it%20creates%20a%20three%20dimensional%20map%20or%20model.)

You will learn the points below from this content:
1. Point Cloud Basics: A point cloud is a 3D collection of data points with specific X, Y, and Z coordinates, used to create detailed 3D maps or models.
2. Creation Methods: Point clouds are generated using LiDAR, which involves laser scanning, or photogrammetry, which uses images to triangulate and plot points in 3D space.
3. Applications: Point clouds are used to create topographic maps, digital elevation models, and 3D models for various purposes, including city planning and construction.
4. Advantages: Point cloud modeling is efficient, accurate, and cost-effective, especially when processed using software or captured with drones.
5. Industry Usage: Point clouds are widely used by construction companies, civil engineers, and other industries for precise mapping and modeling.

<!--
A point cloud is a collection of individual data points in a three-dimensional plane with each point having a set coordinate on the X, Y, and Z axis. When each point is placed together, it creates a three dimensional map or model. For example, if the data compiled to create the point cloud is taken from a neighborhood, it will show the location of each building, tree, and power line, along with its elevation relative to the ground. Depending on the data gathered and how dense the point cloud is, the more details and specific types of terrain and structures you’ll see.

Point clouds are generally created in one of two ways, LiDAR and photogrammetry, and are georeferenced for accuracy.

- LiDAR
Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR, is a remote sensing method that scans an area with a laser and then measures the light’s reflection and range from the earth’s surface. This data is cross-referenced with GPS and inertial measurement units and each pulse of the scanner creates a data point. Because laser scanners can have a scan speed of well over a million points per second, LiDAR is the most accurate, detailed, and precise way to create a point cloud.

- Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry creates measurements using a series of images. The photographs are taken from different locations, and points are triangulated then plotted on the three dimensional space. Drones can take thousands of pictures of an area from different angles and analysts can process the images together to develop a point cloud, filling minimal gaps with surface reconstruction.
