This section focuses on assessing the performance of machine learning models for predicting riverbank erosion.

## Key learning objectives:
- 4.2.1 Model performance/evaluation metrics in machine learning
- 4.2.2 Use case(s) of model performance metrics in machine learning

## 4.2.1 Model performance metrics in machine learning
### a. (Basic) [Model Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/05/model-evaluation-metrics-machine-learning.html)
The content discusses the importance of evaluating machine learning models using various metrics to ensure they generalize well on unseen data, rather than just memorizing the training data. It introduces the confusion matrix, a tool used to evaluate classification models by comparing predicted and actual values, highlighting key terms: True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative. It also explains Type I (False Positive) and Type II (False Negative) errors in hypothesis testing. Accurate model evaluation involves metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and gain and loss chart, which are derived from the confusion matrix to measure a model's performance effectively.

### b. (Basic) [Performance metrics in machine learning](https://neptune.ai/blog/performance-metrics-in-machine-learning-complete-guide)
Performance metrics are crucial in the machine learning pipeline for quantifying progress and judging model performance. They are essential for both regression and classification tasks, with various popular metrics providing insights into how models interpret data. Unlike loss functions, which are used to train models through optimization methods and need to be differentiable, metrics are used to monitor and measure performance and do not need to be differentiable.

## 4.2.2 Use case(s) of model performance metrics in machine learning
### a. (Advanced)  [Estimation of riverbank erosion by combining channel morphological models with AI techniques](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19475705.2024.2359983)
This study models riverbank erosion by combining the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. It introduces a two-stage training process that emphasizes preprocessing data related to hydrology, geomorphology, and soil properties. Key outputs include vertical and horizontal displacements of the riverbed and bank, and channel width changes. The method demonstrates high accuracy, with low mean relative errors (<0.081), high correlation coefficients (>0.981), and R-squared values over 0.963, making it both accurate and operationally efficient for practical applications in predicting riverbank erosion.

### b. (Advanced)  [River bank erosion prediction using multivariable linear regression](http://jase.tku.edu.tw/articles/jase-202412-27-12-0006.pdf)
This research introduces a multivariable linear regression approach to predict riverbank erosion speed. The model is both simple and interpretable, successfully identifying key factors like river depth and hydraulic gradient as primary contributors to erosion. Despite using a small dataset of only 27 records, the method predicts erosion speed with an error of around 2 meters per year. The study suggests that a larger dataset or a more complex regression model could further improve prediction accuracy in the future.

### c. (Advanced)  [Predictive models for the estimation of riverbank erosion rates](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/~pierre/ce_old/Projects/Paperspdf/Saadon%20et%20al.%20Catena%202020.pdf)
This study addresses the complex process of riverbank erosion by developing empirical models to estimate erosion rates, focusing on River Bernam in Malaysia. Using 358 erosion pin measurements and following strict international protocols, the study analyzes factors influencing erosion, such as hydraulic flow, soil characteristics, and bank geometry. The models use statistical approaches, with logarithmic-transformation equations proving to be the most accurate predictors, achieving up to 93.5% accuracy. The study identifies key influential factors, while others, like bank angle and channel reach, show weak correlations with erosion rates.
