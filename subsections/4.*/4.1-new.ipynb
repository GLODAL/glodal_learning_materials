    "Vector features can be decomposed into three different geometric primitives: points, polylines and polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point\n",
    "\n",
    "A point is composed of one coordinate pair representing a specific location in a coordinate system. Points are the most basic geometric primitives having no length or area.\n",
    "- Line String\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines usually represent features that are linear in nature. For example, maps show rivers, roads, and pipelines as vector lines.\n",
    "- Polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "Polygon features are enclosed areas like dams, islands, country boundaries and so on. Like polyline features, polygons are created from a series of vertices that are connected with a continuous line. \n",

    "### 4.1.2 Theory and practice on accuracy assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Accuracy Assessment](https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/39544/1/Unit-14.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy assessment is the final step in the analysis of remote sensing data which help us to verify how accurate our results are. It is carried out once the interpretation/classification has been completed. Here, we are interested in assessing accuracy of thematic maps or classified images which is known as thematic or classification accuracy. The accuracy is concerned with the correspondence between class label and ‘true’ class. A ‘true’ class is defined as what is observed on the ground during field surveys. For example, a class labeled as water on a classified image/map is actually water on the ground.\n",
    "To perform an accuracy assessment, we compare:\n",
    " - Interpreted map/classified image from remote sensing data.\n",
    " - Reference map, high-resolution images, or ground truth data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship is expressed through:\n",
    " - Error Matrix: Compares the two information sources.\n",
    " - Kappa Coefficient: Measures the agreement between rows and columns of the error matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "Accuracy in the context of image interpretation refers to the quality of information derived from remote sensing data. This can be assessed qualitatively by comparing map images to actual ground views to see if they \"look right.\" Quantitative assessments, however, involve identifying and measuring map errors by comparing map data with ground truth data, assumed to be 100% correct. Image classification accuracy is often reported as a percentage and includes consumer's accuracy (CA) and producer's accuracy (PA). CA is calculated by comparing correctly classified pixels to the total pixels assigned to a category, accounting for errors of commission. It takes errors of commission into account by telling the consumer that, for all areas identified as category X, a certain percentage are actually correct. PA measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels in a category relative to the total actual pixels in that category. Producer’s accuracy measures errors of omission.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculation of Classification Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is often expressed in terms of consumer’s and producer’s accuracies which is obtained from an error matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "An error matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a powerful tool used in the field of remote sensing to assess the accuracy of a classified image. It provides a detailed comparison between the classified data and ground truth data, helping to quantify how well the classification process has performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of its key components and how it’s used:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Structure of an Error Matrix\n",
    "The error matrix is typically presented in a square table format where:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Rows represent the actual ground truth classes.\n",
    " - Columns represent the predicted classes from the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell in the matrix indicates the number of pixels that were classified into a particular category. For example, the cell in the first row and first column shows the number of pixels that were correctly classified as class 1 (true positives for class 1), while the cell in the first row and second column shows the number of pixels that were incorrectly classified as class 2 (false positives for class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Metrics Derived from the Error Matrix\n",
    " - Overall Accuracy: Overall accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of correctly classified pixels (sum of the diagonal elements) by the total number of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Producer’s Accuracy (PA): Producer’s accuracy, or recall, measures the proportion of actual pixels correctly classified for each class. It is calculated for each class by dividing the number of correctly classified pixels by the total number of pixels in that class (row sum).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consumer’s Accuracy (CA): Consumer’s accuracy, or precision, measures the proportion of pixels classified correctly out of the total classified pixels for each class (column sum).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Kappa Coefficient: The Kappa coefficient (κ) measures the agreement between the classification and the ground truth, correcting for chance agreement. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement and 0 indicates no agreement beyond chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Basic) [Accuracy Assessment](https://ebooks.inflibnet.ac.in/geop10/chapter/accuracy-assessment/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is defined as “correctness” i.e. it measures the agreement between a Standard assumed to be correct and a classified image of unknown quality. An accuracy assessment compares two sources of information: 1) pixels or polygons from a classification map developed from remotely sensed data and 2) ground reference test information, if the image classification corresponds closely with the standard, it is said to be “accurate”. \n"

    "\n",
    "A data quality checklist that can help you validate and repair your geospatial data. Validation steps will vary to some extent depending on the type of data (2D, GIS, raster, etc.), but this list will provide a good guideline. The example of raster data check show in below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check the Coordinate System:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the coordinate system (e.g., WGS84, NAD83) of your data matches the coordinate system expected by the destination system. Misaligned coordinate systems can result in incorrect data positioning, which can be critical in spatial data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Why check the projection?](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-can-you-check-projection-your-shapefile-qgis-before#:~:text=Then%2C%20right%2Dclick%20on%20the,and%20code%20of%20the%20projection.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection of a vector/raster layer determines how it relates to other spatial data and the real world. If you use vector/raster layer with different projections in the same map or analysis, you may encounter errors, misalignments, or inconsistencies. For example, if you overlay a shapefile (vector layer) of countries in a Mercator projection, which preserves angles but exaggerates areas, with a shapefile of population density in an equal-area projection, which preserves areas but distorts shapes, you may get misleading results. Therefore, you should always check the projection of your vector/raster layer before using them, and reproject them if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to check the projection in QGIS?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Right-click on the layer (raster or vector layer) in the Layers panel and select Properties.\n",
    " - In the Properties window, click on the Information tab and look for the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) section to view the name and code of the projection.\n",

    "\n",
    "Calibrating remote sensing data is a crucial step for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information derived from satellite or aerial images. Remote sensing data can be affected by various sources of error, such as atmospheric conditions, sensor characteristics, geometric distortions, and radiometric variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information below show some of the most important techniques for calibrating remote sensing data and how they can improve your GIS analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Radiometric calibration\n",
    "   \n",
    "Radiometric calibration adjusts the pixel values of remote sensing data to accurately reflect the true radiance or reflectance of the Earth's surface. This process is crucial for comparing data from different sensors, dates, or locations, and for mitigating the effects of atmospheric scattering, absorption, and haze. Radiometric calibration can be performed using different methods, such as dark object subtraction, histogram matching, empirical line fitting, or radiative transfer models.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Geometric calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric calibration is the process of correcting spatial distortions in remote sensing data caused by factors such as sensor orientation, platform motion, terrain relief, and map projection. This calibration is essential for accurately aligning data with other spatial layers, measuring distances and areas, and identifying features and patterns. THe example methods for geometric calibration is orthorectification, image registration, resampling, and geometric transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Spectral calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral calibration is the process of adjusting the spectral characteristics of remote sensing data to match the spectral response of the target objects or materials. This is important for identifying and classifying land cover types, vegetation types, mineral types, or water quality parameters. Spectral calibration can be performed using different methods, such as spectral matching, spectral unmixing, spectral normalization, or spectral enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Temporal calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal calibration is the process of adjusting the temporal resolution of remote sensing data to match the temporal dynamics of the phenomena or processes of interest. This is important for monitoring changes, trends, and anomalies over time, and for analyzing seasonal, annual, or long-term variations. Temporal calibration can be performed using different methods, such as temporal interpolation, temporal aggregation, temporal smoothing, or temporal filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Calibration tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration tools are the software applications or modules that facilitate the implementation of the calibration techniques described above. They can be integrated into GIS software or standalone programs that can handle various types of remote sensing data and formats. Some examples of calibration tools are ENVI, ERDAS IMAGINE, ArcGIS Image Analyst, QGIS, or R."

    "\n",
    "Coordinate systems are the foundation for understanding and working with geospatial data, as they provide a standardized way to represent geographic locations on the Earth’s surface. When a shapefile is missing its coordinate system, it can lead to misaligned layers, incorrect measurements, and a host of other issues that hinder accurate data visualization and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Here’s a step-by-step process to help you identify the coordinate system:\n",
    "Check metadata and accompanying files:\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a shapefile, it’s essential to check its metadata and accompanying files to gain insights into the dataset, such as its coordinate system, attribute information, and data sources. Here’s how to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Check accompanying files: A shapefile consists of several mandatory and optional files, including:\n",
    " - .shp: The main file containing geometry data.\n",
    " - shx: The index file for quick access to geometry data.\n",
    " - dbf: The dBASE table containing attribute data.\n",
    " - prj: The projection file containing the coordinate system information (if available)\n",
    "2.  Examine the .prj file: The .prj file stores the projection and coordinate system information for a shapefile. If this file is missing or empty, you’ll need to identify the coordinate system yourself. If the file is present and populated, you can open it with a text editor to view the [Well-Known Text (WKT) description of the coordinate system](https://mapscaping.com/beginners-guide-to-srid/).\n",
    "3.  Explore attribute data: Open the attribute table of the shapefile in your GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS) to examine the attribute data. This may give you additional context about the dataset, including its source, collection methods, or other relevant information.\n",
    "4.  Review any accompanying documentation: Sometimes, shapefiles come with accompanying documentation files, like a README.txt or a PDF report, that provide information about the dataset. Make sure to review these documents for any details about the coordinate system, data source, or other important information.\n",
    "5.  Reach out to the data provider: If you cannot find the information you need in the metadata or accompanying files, consider reaching out to the data provider or source. They may be able to provide the necessary information, such as the coordinate system or data collection methods.\n",
