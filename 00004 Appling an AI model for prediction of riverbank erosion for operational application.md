## Module 4: Appling an AI model for prediction of riverbank erosion for operational application
This module focuses on developing and operationalizing an AI model for predicting riverbank erosion to support disaster management efforts. Participants will learn about data quality control, model evaluation, and improvement techniques to enhance the model performance.

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Enable designing quality control of geospatial and satellite data.
- Enable evaluating model performances in machine learning processes
- Enable designing improving models by machine learning
