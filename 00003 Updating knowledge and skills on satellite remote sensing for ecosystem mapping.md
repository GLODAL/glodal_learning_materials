# Module 3: Updating knowledge and skills on satellite remote sensing for ecosystem mapping
This module aims to provide participants with the latest advancements in satellite remote sensing for assessing and monitoring forestry ecosystems. 

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand the latest methods for estimating biomass and monitoring forest cover change.
- Apply remote sensing techniques for habitat analysis and mapping forest types.
- Assess the impact of environmental changes on forest ecosystems using satellite data.
