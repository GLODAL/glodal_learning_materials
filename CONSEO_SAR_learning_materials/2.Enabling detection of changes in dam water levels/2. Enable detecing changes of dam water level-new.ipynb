Since the radar incidence angle (the difference between the slope angle of the terrain and the altitude angle of the satellite) affects the observed values of the synthetic aperture radar, pre-processing to compensate for this effect may be necessary. [ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data product L2.2 performs slope gradient correction processing, but it is processed only for ScanSAR and is released free of charge](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/palsar2_l22_e.htm), and standard products are not provided.\n",

For example, the shape of the water surface in a completely waterlogged condition could be stored in advance as a polygon layer in the GIS, and the change detection analysis could be processed only inside that polygon. It may also be useful to treat neighboring pixels as clusters and consider clusters smaller than a certain size as noise."
