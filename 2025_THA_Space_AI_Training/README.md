### Introduction and installation
This section provides an introduction to the Prithvi model and the installation instructions for setting up the environment to run the notebook.

### Training data preparation
The training data preparation involves working with SPOT images and includes the following steps:
  - Rasterizing land use data
  - Calculating NDVI and NDWI from SPOT images
  - Splitting images into patches (224x224)
  - Visualizing sample patch images
  - Calculating Mean and Standard Deviation 

### Fine-tuning the Prithvi model
This section covers the process of fine-tuning the Prithvi model using the prepared training data.

### Image inferencing
After training the model, this section demonstrates how to perform inferencing on new images.
