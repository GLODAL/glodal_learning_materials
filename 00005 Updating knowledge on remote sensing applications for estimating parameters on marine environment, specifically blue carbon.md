# Module 5: Updating knowledge on remote sensing applications for blue carbon assessment
This module aims to provide participants with the latest advancements in satellite remote sensing for assessing and monitoring blue carbon ecosystems.

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Apply satellite remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring seaweed beds
- Understand the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate change mitigation
- Estimate and monitor blue carbon stocks using satellite data
