# Module 9: Detecting deforestation from oil palm plantation expansion using ALOS-2 data

This section is designed for learners interested in detecting the expansion of oil palm plantations using ALOS-2 imagery, with a case study in Indonesia. By accessing ALOS-2 imagery from multiple years, spanning from 2007 to 2023, long-term trends in oil palm plantation expansion can be mapped. Through the comparison of backscatter values over time and the detection of changes in areas impacted by oil palm plantations using the image differencing method, it becomes possible to visualize and map the increase in oil palm plantations and the associated decline in forest cover.
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
-  Understand ALOS-2 Data: gain a comprehensive understanding of ALOS-2 satellite data,  including radar backscatter and polarization characteristics (HH and HV), with examples for distinguishing land cover types like oil palm plantations, forests, urban areas, and water bodies.
- Analyze land cover changes: use ALOS-2 imagery to identify and analyze land assess deforestation and oil palm expansion over different timescales (short-term, mid-term, and long-term) and detect significant changes through comparative analysis.

## Key learning objectives:
-   9.1 Basic of python for visualize SAR satellite images for tropical forest with oil palm plantations.
-   9.2 Detect areas of changes caused by oil palm plantations including comparisions with optical observations.
