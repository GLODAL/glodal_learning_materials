# Crane detection and classification in satellite images using deep learning

This section's outcome is enable coding on crane detection and classification in satellite images using deep learning. The learning objectives are as below. Althoguh the contents scope cranes in ports, the detection techniques will be useful for other ground objects.

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. To understand practice on preprocessing of satellite image data for training dataset in deep learning
2. To understand practice on model training using MMDetection
3. To understand practice on model evaluation using MMDetection
4. To understand tips and hacks to improve model training and performance

The contents are compiled into [a single JupyterNotebook](subsections/00007/Crane_Detection.ipynb).
