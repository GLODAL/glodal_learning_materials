# 1.Designing PoC on digital twins in renewable energy

In this session, we will design the material for people who are interested in evaluating location for PV to balance supply-demand, near-real-time evaluation of cloud contamination affecting PV generate, and Connecting satellite-based evaluation with geospatial information, such as electricity demand data collected from customers and transmits infrastructure. However, they should have experience on operations of the renewable energy grid, and have a little experience on remote sensing and geospatial data applications.
