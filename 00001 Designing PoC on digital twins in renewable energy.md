# Module 1: Geospatial science and remote sensing supporting digital twins in renewable energy

This module is designed for individuals with experience in renewable energy grid operations who seek to use geospatial data and remote sensing for digital twins for optimizing Photovoltaic (PV) installations and operations. The focus is on leveraging satellite and geospatial data to address key challenges such as balancing supply and demand, assessing real-time cloud impact on PV generation, and integrating data from various sources.

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Evaluate PV potentials using satellite and geospatial data.
- Design object detection models for electricity infrastructure.
- Analyze geospatial data to support decision-making in the energy sector.
